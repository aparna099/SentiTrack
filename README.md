# Sentiment Analysis of App Reviews for Requirement Engineering

## Objective
The primary objective of this research is to explore the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in the field of requirements engineering using app reviews. Specifically, we aim to:

Evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis.

Analyse the impact of word semantics on Sentiment Analysis.

Investigate the trade-offs between accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency.

## Dataset
Dataset was collected from Hugging Face. 

## Methodology
This research employs five different machine learning classifiers:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Maximum Entropy
Decision Tree
Neural Network


## Key Findings
Our research yields several significant findings, including:

The importance of semantic richness in sentiment classification, is demonstrated by improved precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 scores using the Bag of Words (BoW) Glove representation.

The consistent outperformance of the Decision Tree algorithm over other models, highlights its suitability for precise sentiment classification.

The balance between accuracy and computational efficiency is offered by the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models, making them suitable for real-time applications.


The Decision Tree algorithm's capability to navigate complex relationships within text data while maintaining computational efficiency, making it an ideal choice for real-world applications.
